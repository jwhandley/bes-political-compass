# BES Political Compass

This is a simple website that uses the 10 left-right and
libertarian-authoritarian values questions from the
[British Election Study Internet Panel](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data-objects/panel-study-data/)
to create a political compass style quiz that places users on the same 2-d axis
as respondents to the survey. I quickly threw it together as a way of learning
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev).
